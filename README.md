## Meditations (January 12th)
A game made for Meditations - a collection of games available for only a day, each day of the year. Please support all the developers and take a look at their work! This game will be available on January 12th each year - I recommend playing it on that day and only looking at the source code afterwards.

## Release
The game is available using the [Meditation Games Launcher](https://meditations.games/) each year on January 12th, or on [itch.io](https://danielilett.itch.io/baa-aaa-aaa).

## License
This software is licensed under the MIT License. Feel free to take it apart and figure out how it works. Apologies if the code is a little messy - I made it on a fairly tight deadline!

It was developed using Unity 2018.2.18f1, so it should open in that or any later version.

Thank you for playing my games.

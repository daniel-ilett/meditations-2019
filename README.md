# Meditations
A game made for Meditations - a collection of games available for only a day, each day of the year. Please support all the developers and take a look at their work!

This software is licensed under the MIT License. Feel free to take it apart and figure out how it works. Apologies if the code is a little messy - I made it on a fairly tight deadline!

It was developed using Unity 2018.2.18f1, so it should open in that or any later version.
